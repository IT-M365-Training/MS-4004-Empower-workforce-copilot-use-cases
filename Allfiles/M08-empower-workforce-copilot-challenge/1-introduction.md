Up to this point, you've completed Use Case training exercises that provided step-by-step instructions on how to use Copilot in Microsoft 365 to solve various business scenarios. Additionally, each exercise used only a single Copilot for Microsoft 365 app. In this module, you must attempt to complete similar business scenarios, but in a more challenging environment (hence the module name - Challenge Use Case).

In this module, the exercises only include the business scenario. There's no further training content supporting the Copilot apps that are used, and the exercise doesn't include step-by-step instructions. Plus, each exercise uses multiple Microsoft 365 copilots rather than just one.

With the experience that you gained in the prior seven Use Case modules using Copilot for Microsoft 365, you're now ready to remove the training wheels and see how you do working with Copilot without any supervision. There are no time limits, and no right or wrong results. Remember, Copilot is your Microsoft 365 assistant. Use these training opportunities to expand your Copilot knowledge and to envision how it can help you in your real-world business environment. And most of all - Enjoy!

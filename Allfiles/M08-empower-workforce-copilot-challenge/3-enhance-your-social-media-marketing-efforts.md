Your strategy consists of the following two-pronged approach:<br>

 -  You want to use Copilot in Word to create engaging content for your blog and social media.
 -  You want to use Copilot in Excel to analyze customer feedback and engagement data to help identify trends and insights.

You contracted with a local marketing firm to capture customer feedback and engagement data, which they stored in an Excel spreadsheet.
